# **Hospital Prototype App**

## **Project Overview**

This repository contains the wireframe design of a hospital prototype app, created using Figma. This project serves as a **test of my wireframing skills**. The app is designed to showcase the following features:

1. **Sign up or login** functionality for user accounts.
2. **Booking appointments** with medical personnel across different departments.
3. **E-medicine chat** feature for communication with doctors.

While the wireframe focuses on design, the **future implementation** will involve front-end and back-end features, as outlined below.

The wireframe consists of 3 main pages:

1. **Logo Page** – The first page displayed upon opening the app.
2. **Sign Up / Sign In Page** – For user registration and login.
3. **Departments and Doctors Page** – Displays various medical departments and top-rated doctors.
